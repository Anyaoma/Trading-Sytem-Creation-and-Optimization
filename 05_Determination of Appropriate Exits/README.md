## Determination of Appropriate Exits
The tool of statistical research will be employed to investigate exits quantitatively. Exits cannot be determined independently from the relative entry, neither can exits points be transferable to different entry logic. It is important that one spends the time to develop suitable exits for the different entry or time scale.  This would involve analysing  all single trades taken in the context of the trading strategy and determining useful stop-levels and profit targets. In other words, it involves analysing the distribution of trades and examining each trade individually.

## The use of Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
The Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) technique is defined as the most intraday price movement against your position. Put differently, it is the lowest open equity during the lifespan of a trade. This tool enables one to evaluate the trading system's individual trades to determine at what dollar or percentage amount to place the protective stop.

#### Figure 5.1: The MAE graph of SMA crossover system. Green: Profitable trades, red: Losing trades. System tested Google stocks, 15-minute bars, 21/10/2002–4/7/2008, with entry time window 9.45am – 1.15pm ET. Input parameters SLOW=20, FAST=17, LOOKBACK=10. Without exits, always in the market, including on average £10 slippage and commissions per round turn.

The graph above (fig5.1) shows all 227 trades that were taken within the test period. For each trade there is the amount of drawdown that occurred in relation to the realised profit or loss. The profitable trades are shown as green up arrows and the losing trades are represented as red down arrows. The graph aids to figure out how much unrealised loss must be incured by a trade before it typically does not recover. In this way the MAE graph tells you when to cut your loss because the risks associated with the trade are no longer justified. This gives one a valuable indication of where to place the protective stop.
