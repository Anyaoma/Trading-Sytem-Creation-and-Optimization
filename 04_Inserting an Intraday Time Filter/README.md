## Inserting an Intraday Time Filter
Different Trading strategies exploit different phases of the market within the trading day. Some trading strategies are more successful in the afternoon with short-term breakout strategies, while some might require running the whole night in order to make a profit. Timing trade entry becomes increasingly important because markets are controlled by people, and people in turn, operate on daily schedules. Stocks trade on a single local exchange schedule (e.g., NYSE: 09:30–16:00 ET). During market open (first 30–60 mins), there is very high volume & volatility. Lots of institutional orders hitting, and gaps resolving, which is good for short-term breakout strategies. During the midday (11:00–14:00 ET), market is quiet, and there is low volume. Mean-reversion/market-making strategies work better here while trend-following usually fails. At market close (last 1–2 hours), volume rises again, institutions adjust positions, and there are closing auctions. Breakout/trend strategies can work. As a direct consequence, it is worth examining how different time filters change the outcome of the trading strategy.

## Finding the best Entry Time
To determine the best trading time, the trading strategy is restricted to a four hour trading window everyday. Then the starting time of the trading window is shifted in steps of 15 minutes throughout the day in order to find the best window.
