## Variation of the input parameters: optimisation and stability diagrams

Every trading system is in some form an optimization; in choosing any trading system one must have compared it to some others, and chosen it because it shows favorable, and predictive results. So the key question is: which set of parameter values works best for the trading system backtest and produce profits in the future in real trading? While the answer to this question is different for every trading system, the one rule that applie to all is that: the neighbourhood or surrounding values of the chosen parameter values must be nearly as profitable as the chosen system parameters, and the bigger this profitable parametr range, the better.

According to Murray Ruggiero, 'If you don’t like the neighbouring numbers, you’ve got a
problem, because odds are, you will wind up with the results of
the neighbouring set of parameters.'
